 guess we need a Data Specific Language, im thinking we structure it after some configuration management software, and the AI would look for task completions to start off with, based on some given input, and would have behaviors based around the status of tasks, that would be configurable, in conf files ... there would be a server location for the AI, and it would push or pull status from various clients on mobile devices or sensors around the house
[9:30 PM]
the UI would set the conf files, target clients, tasks ectera... but that is just an intial activity, there would be a limitless application of it really
[9:32 PM]
anyway, CHEF, Ansible, Puppet dunno what to base it off of
[9:33 PM]
yeah, smart watches, smart phones or any other internet of thing device could work with it, even ones we specially design
[9:33 PM]
want the thing to be voice driven
[9:34 PM]
music playing devices (edited)
[9:36 PM]
id like it to integrate with some apps too
[9:37 PM]
med dispensing
[9:37 PM]
location tracking of things in house
[9:39 PM]
like, maybe checking in and out some things as you use them, voice activated, for tools... you would never use this as is but if it is incorperated in the overall design as you do a task it could help
[9:40 PM]
hmmm

i think ansible or saltstack, cause its just YAML Python
[9:42 PM]
of course the use would be free

Message #talkative-chat
i guess the tasklist would be based on priority and urgency, and the conf file would dictate behavoir based on those factors, as well as need by dates
[9:51 PM]
but some tasks will be included in the DSL and there will be meta data around them that would also be updated and used based on the conf file
[9:52 PM]
need to integrate a reward system as well
[9:52 PM]
to gamify your accomplishments
[9:53 PM]
maybe you could gain levels based on regular performace of task completions
[9:54 PM]
i hope we can get a group interested in this project, i guess ill get one of those free online offices so we could work on this
[9:55 PM]
i am really interested in making devices to integrate with this as well, dont have any ideas yet
[9:55 PM]
but a smart phone and smart watch are a good place to start for a client
[9:58 PM]
im going to listed to jessicas next video on motivation and try and incorporate that, id like to have the AI break down goals into specific peices that are trackable, in a voice conversation with you
[9:58 PM]
that is why the DSL is important
